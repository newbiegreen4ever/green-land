<h2 id="why-choose-to-learn-at-office">Why choose to learn at office</h2>

<p>I work at a desk job, and I can somehow relate to your feeling. I adopt a slack-and-relax approach when learning code at office.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This job pays little, and I am just an unimportant small potato rotting in the cubicle. Instead of wasting my time here, why not try to make a better use of it?</p>

<h2 id="slack-and-relax-approach">Slack-and-relax approach</h2>

<p>My practice of discrete learning / slacking has been gradually changing since the first day of my work.</p>

<h3 id="i-ingesting-information-all-the-time-about-3-months">I. Ingesting information all the time (about 3 months)</h3>

<p>I am lucky enough to work at an office with loosely controlled IT system. I can freely use wifi, although youtube is blocked. At first, I tried to read as much as possible during office hours, because I felt lagging behind by not learning about programming while letting time slipped away in the cubicle.</p>

<p>I binged on information about javaScript by opening numerous tabs in Chrome when (pretending to be) working on my full-time day job. Luckily my boss did not give a damn on what was in my browser as long as I got my job done.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="ii-feeling-tired-for-no-reason-about-2-months">II. Feeling tired for no reason (about 2 months)</h3>

<p>Information binging, like binge eating, is not a sustainable habit. Due to frequent switching of focus, the side-effect of multitasking (I know some can switch their focus fast, but I simply can’t do that…) started to take its toll. I often felt tired for no reason, even though my job is quite light on duty comparing to my colleagues (they are the more important employees, whereas I am just a clerk proving clerical support). This tiredness made it difficult to focus even I got off from work. Not the optimal state for freecodecamping.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="iii-culling-input-and-adjusting-output">III. Culling input and adjusting output</h3>

<p>I started my information dieting by only reading information from a few trusted and quality sources during lunchbreak e.g. freecodecamp medium, codeburst.io2, &lt;&lt; Eloquent JavaScript &gt;&gt;. I appreciated each byte of information when I ate less. Also, this freed up more time for my day job, and my performance was more satisfactory.</p>

<p>If you could not use wifi, emailing simple questions and writing code on paper are good ways to slack and relax.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="iv-working-hard-for-myself-and-my-salary">IV. Working hard for myself and my salary</h3>

<p>After regaining balance between working full-time and freecodecamping, I started to brainstorm ideas and hacks to make my life in cubicle easier. Though my boss is not supportive, but writing one or two VBA templates for docketing in Word would not hurt. This also gave me a slight edge over my co-workers.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="v-let-s-slack">V. Let&rsquo;s slack</h3>

<p>Now, my practice of slacking is :</p>

<ol>
<li>Reading a piece of information / problem during office hour</li>
<li>Thinking about it when commuting</li>
<li>Working on it at home</li>
</ol>

<hr class="gradient">

<h2 id="unexpected-benefits">Unexpected benefits</h2>

<p>Actually working on different stages during different hours is not a bad idea. This gives the problem sufficient time to sink in my head. Problem solving becomes easier when the problem itself unfolds and becomes a relaxed coil, rather that a tight mess. Unfolding takes time, so a bit slacking during office hour is actually beneficial by kickstarting the unfolding process earlier in a day.</p>

<hr class="gradient">

<h2 id="endnote">Endnote</h2>

<p>As an employee, it is nearly impossible for me to concentrate 100% in my full-time office job (afterall, this is only a job). Discrete learning / slacking helps me to relax when working my day job (around 15% of my mental energy goes to slacking and kickstarting problem sinking). Be sure to reserve some mental energy for your day job, and don’t overwork yourself in freecodecamping. Try to find a point of intersection between the two.</p>

<p>Wish you all the best in juggling a full-time office job and freecodecamping!</p>
